 This is a normal text file 
 Learning python is fun but tricky asf
 Today is chilly and I hate cold.
 
f = open("lesson.txt") opens a file
f = open("lesson.txt",'w') opens file for writing
f = open("lesson.txt",'x') creates new file
f = open("lesson.txt",'t') opens fle in text mode (can write on it)
f = open("lesson.txt",'a') opens file for appending
f = open("lesson.txt",'b') opens file in binary cannot write on it
f = open("Lesson.txt",'+') opens file for updating a file
